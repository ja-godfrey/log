With another school year comes another round of Accelerate grantees.  This year, Accelerate received roughly 200 applications and was able to bring in 18 providers for their [[Call to Effective Action]] grant. 

Below is my initial attempt to update the Accelerate map so that it contains the new locations that we will be working in during the 2024-2025 school year. I suspect that these locations will change a little as there is always some delta between forecasted implementation and actual implementation.

The map is in light mode with a QR code to the website where you can view the map as a full page. This is mostly to help others at Accelerate who print out the map for various meetings.
