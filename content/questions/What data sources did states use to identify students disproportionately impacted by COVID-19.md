This post is a different configuration of "[[How many data sources did states use to identify students disproportionately impacted by COVID-19]]?" except it highlights which strategies were most common. 

I think there are some surprises here. For one, I'm surprised that academic outcome data is third rather than first. I'm also surprised that state admin data is last. There must be something I don't understand about that category since I would think that all this data (demographics, outcomes, etcetera) comes from state admin data. Truly, I know nothing.
