Some states have a lot of money to spend before November 2024. This data is from the June 2024 snapshot, by the way. This may be worth following up on to show how much each state has to spend per student.

I suspect that once again there is some reporting error. I know for a fact Colorado hasn't spent *nothing.* I've seen their expenditures in action during a site visit led by #spencer-ellis.
