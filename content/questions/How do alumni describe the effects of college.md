The fully published article has more information, but here is the abbreviated answer to the question:  
- Alumni frequently cited personal integrity and self-knowledge, vocational preparedness, interpersonal skills, and advanced intellectual skills as key effects of their undergraduate education, with coursework being the most influential factor.
- Negative experiences, though less common, highlighted issues like insufficient academic guidance, financial pressures, and the perceived irrelevance of some coursework to career goals, impacting alumni perceptions of their education.
- Alumni's appreciation for the broad foundation provided by general education often increased over time, despite initial skepticism during their undergraduate years.
- Some alumni reported feeling unsupported by advisors, particularly those from marginalized backgrounds, leading to negative experiences in navigating their educational pathways.
- The findings underscore the importance of effective advising and support systems in enhancing the perceived value and outcomes of undergraduate education.
