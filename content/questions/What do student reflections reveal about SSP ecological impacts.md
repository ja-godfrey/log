The fully published article has more information, but here is the abbreviated answer to the question: 
- Students' reflections reveal how they perceive themselves as writers and their understanding of college writing expectations.
- Analysis of over half a million words from student survey responses provides insights into potential tensions between students' and institutions' views on academic writing.
- The study highlights the importance of considering both placement decisions and the qualitative aspects of student self-assessments in understanding SSP's broader impact.
- Corpus data can be a valuable tool for exploring the alignment or misalignment between student self-perceptions and institutional expectations in a self-placement ecology.
